# About this website

This is made using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a single binary static site
generator written in Rust with support for just about anything you could want in
a static site.

Currently, I heavily rely on the [Abridge](https://abridge.netlify.app/) theme
to provide structure and utilities, though I would like to depend less on it in
the future. It's been a great starting point, and I'd certainly recommend it.

The dark theme copies Atom's (RIP) OneDark theme. The light theme is a custom
adaptation of OneDark to a light palette.

I document the entire process of building this site on my blog. Check it out if
you're interested in the site in more detail!
