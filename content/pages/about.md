# About this website

This is made using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a single binary static site
generator written in Rust with support for just about anything you could want in
a static site.

Currently, I heavily rely on the [Abridge](https://abridge.netlify.app/) theme
to provide structure and utilities, though I would like to depend less on it in
the future. It's been a great starting point, but it has more than I need.

The source for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/GabrielDTB/gabrieltb.me).
