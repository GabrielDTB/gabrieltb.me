This site is made using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a single binary static site generator written in Rust
with support for just about anything you could want in a static site.

Currently I heavily rely on the [Abridge](https://abridge.netlify.app/) theme to provide
structure and utilities, though I would like to depend less on it in the future. 
It's been a great starting point and it will take a while to make everything 'mine'.

The dark theme is completely inspired by Atom's (rest in peace) OneDark theme. 
Some finishing touches are needed but mostly I'm just copy and pasting values.
The light theme is unfinished but I will try to create a bright light theme using similar colors to OneDark.

I document my entire process of building this site on the blog. 
I'd recommend checking it out if you're interested in the site in more detail.
