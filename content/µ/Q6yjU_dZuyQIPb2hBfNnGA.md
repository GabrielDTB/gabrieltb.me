Reusable bags are incredibly ironic. One of my roommates
orders a lot of delivery food and groceries. Included
with that order is at minimum one reusable bag. We have an
entire box of reusable bags now, and I don't think we'll
ever want for a bag again. At this point, the only thing
to do with the bags is to throw them away. Like clothing,
they're not really compostable, nor are they really going
to be recycled. They'll just end up in a landfill somewhere,
get shipped off to another country, and be burned. Oh,
and they'll produce more emissions than a plastic bag ever
would. But at least they're not killing the turtles, right?

The thing that kills me is that these bags are meant to
reduce waste by being strong enough to reuse. This was also
the motivation behind the invention of the plastic bag.
Somehow, that lesson wasn't learned the first time.
