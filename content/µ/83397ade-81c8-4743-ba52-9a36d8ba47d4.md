I grew up reading lots of books. Of the many kinds,
the fantasy genre had always appealed to me with its
otherworldly adventures with the entire world at stake.
As I grew older, I began to enjoy slice of life novels as
well, set in a land much different than our own. Whether
the stakes were high or low, I enjoyed experiencing the
carefully crafted worlds of the authors and the characters
that lived in them. Looking back now, I wonder whether
reading was a kind of escapism.

I don't recall most of the details from many of the books,
and it would seem that there was no lasting message the
authors intended to impart, either. If there was, it must
have been lost on me. What was the purpose of reading these
books, then, if not to escape and enter a new world?

In reading, I'd been inspired to build my own world, whether
for a book, a game, or for its own sake. In this world there
are bits and pieces that came from sparks of inspiration
over the years. Is there any purpose to this world, or to
the worlds of others that inspired my own?
